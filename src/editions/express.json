Take less than 15 minutes each day to cover key passages throughout the Bible.**\n\nEvery day, a different theme is explored through a selection of scriptures taken from the Old and New Testaments, as well as the book of Psalms or Proverbs. Nicky and Pippa’s commentary on these excerpts are full of insight, wisdom, and practical application and will give you an in-depth overview of the entirety of the Bible across the year."
